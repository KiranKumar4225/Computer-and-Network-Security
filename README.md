# Computer-and-Network-Security

As part of the MSc Cyber security course, I have completed this module and its coursework has been uploaded. The description of this module is provided below.

## Introduction & Context

In its initial stages, this module reviews and consolidates knowledge of fundamental security concepts, threats, mechanisms, and services. On the basis of an established knowledge base, more advanced topics are presented, explored and discussed through combination lectures and practical sessions. Latest security threat and attack case studies will provide context to the teaching topics.
In general, the module will take a practical approach, offering the students weekly opportunities to implement aspects of the topics discussed. The basis of the assessment will be a portfolio of lab work incorporating research elements into the security issues discussed.
